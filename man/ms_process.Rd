}
\arguments{
\item{mzxml_files}{vector of filepaths to the files}

\item{cwt_params}{CentWaveParam object created by xcms,}

\item{obw_params}{ObiwarpParam object created by xcms,}

\item{pd_params}{PeakDensityParam object created by xcms,}

\item{cores}{numeric number of cores to use for the peakpicking 
(one core = one file peakpicked)}

\item{show_pb}{boolean print a progress bar or not}
}
\value{
XCMSnExp object
}
\description{
Execute the step "Process" of the workflow.
it launch the substeps: 
\itemize{
     \item peakpicking
     \item rT correction
     \item alignment
     \item fill missing peaks
}
Some parameters have a default parameter. This is the case for : 
\itemize{
     \item verboseColumns is TRUE cause we want all the infos 
         exported by XCMS
     \item binSize is 1 cause i find it sufficient & 
         1 is too high to perform a well alignment of the spectras
     \item sampleGroups is equal to the length of the provided files
         I prefer to apply some rules to filter later & that will allow
         the possibility to change this anytime instead of re-run 
         the entire process
     \item minFraction is the minimum integer possible for the same 
         reason than `sampleGroups`
     \item minSamples is at 1, same reason than `sampleGroups`
     \item maxFeatures is at 500 cause the workflow will probably 
         need to deal with some huge datasets
}
