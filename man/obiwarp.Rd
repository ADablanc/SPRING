\item{obw_params}{ObiwarpParam object created by xcms}

\item{operator}{function to use for parallelization (`\%dopar\%`) 
or not (`\%do\%`)}

\description{
perform retention time correction (alignment) between chromatograms of 
     different samples. 
the alignment is based on the complete mz-rt data. This method does not 
     require any identified peaks or defined features. 
This function comes from the XCMS package and only the function `.obiwarp` 
     was imported in order to use & export the parallelisation infos
It force to use the sample with the most peak as the center sample
